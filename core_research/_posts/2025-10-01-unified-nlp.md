# A Unified Framework for NLP Tasks by ReLabel Method

### Abstract
In industry deep learning application, our dataset has a certain number of noisy data. The init datasets are from human labeling or LLM (large language model) generation or user behavior log.
To solve this problem and achieve more than 90 score in dev dataset, we present a framework to find the noisy data and relabel the noisy data, 
given the model predictions as references in relabeling. The process of relabeling can be done manually or using LLM for annotation.
In this paper, we illustrate our idea for a broad set of deep learning tasks, includes classification, sequence tagging, object detection, sequence generation, 
click-through rate prediction. The dev dataset evaluation results and human evaluation results verify our idea.

#### Keywords
NLP, LLM

### 1. Introduction

In recent years, deep learning \cite{ref1} and LLM \cite{ref2} have shown significant improvement on natural language processing(NLP), 
computer vision and speech processing technologies. However, the model performance is limited by the dataset quality. 
The main reason is that the dataset has a certain number of noisy data. 
In this paper, we present a framework to find the noisy data and relabel the noisy data, 
then we further illustrate our idea for sequence tagging, object detection, sequence generation, click-through rate (CTR) prediction.

### 2. Method

Our initial datasets can be sourced from the following three methods:

**Manual Annotation**: Data noise in a manually annotated dataset, using a classification task as an example, occurs when there is disagreement among annotators. For instance, for 3 very similar data to-label, 2 annotators assign label-A, while 1 annotator assigns label-B.

**LLM Generation**: For datasets generated by LLM, data noise in a classification task often stems from overlapping or repetitive definitions for labels within the prompts.

**User Behavior Logs**: Datasets based on user behavior logs are constructed from user actions. For example, in an e-commerce scenario, a dataset can be built based on whether a user clicks on an item or places an order.
