# Improving Text Generation for Product Description via Human Behaviour

### Abstract
Text generation is an important method to generate high quality and available product description from product title. For the product description generation for online E-commerce application, the main problem is how to improve the quality of generated text. In other words, how we judge the quality of text. If all texts are already positive and available, then we find it impossible to manually judge which text is the better text for a product. So if we cannot judge which is a better text manually,  we cannot improve the quality of generated text. In E-commerce, product description is to attract shoppers and improve sales. So we design a method to improve the quality of generated text based on user buying behaviour. Online result shows that our approach improve the sales of products by improving the text quality.
