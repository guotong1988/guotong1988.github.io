# Leveraging User Behaviour to Enhance LLMs for Query Analysis in E-commerce

### Abstract

The problem with using LLMs (Large Language Models) for query analysis in e-commerce search is that the accuracy rate can at most reach up to 90%, due to the lack of domain specific information. However, based on mining query tags from user orders, although the accuracy can reach over 95%, the coverage rate of query tags is limited by the amount of user behavior logs, especially when the business scope is small. In this article, we propose a method for constructing training dataset for query tags, which combines the data by LLMs with user order based data. Models trained on this dataset can achieve a coverage rate of over 95% and an accuracy rate of over 95% for query tagging.
