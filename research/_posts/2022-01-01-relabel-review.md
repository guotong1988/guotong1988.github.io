# Re-Label For Deep Learning: A Review

### abstract
Recently, the fast development of deep learning has brought computer science to a new era. 
In this survey, We first summarize how to achieve 97% accuracy in industry deep learning application in both dev dataset and human evaluation by re-label / labeling-again, based on the principle that deep learning is rule-injected model with some generalization ability. 
Then we extend the re-label method to more possible idea.
In the end, ..
