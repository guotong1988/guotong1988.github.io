# Re-Label For Industry Deep Learning: A Review

### abstract
Recently, the fast development of deep learning has brought computer science to a new era. 
In this survey, We first summarize how to achieve 97% accuracy in industry deep learning application in both dev dataset and human evaluation by re-label / labeling-again, based on the principle that deep learning is rule-injected model with strong generalization ability. 
Then we extend the re-label method to more possible idea.
In the end, ..

### introduction

Deep learning is the deep neural network that has the most strong generalization ability now. 
And the generalization ability is based on the labeled training data. The training data is injected by human knowledge/rule.
Data centric methods without changing the ground-truth-label do not have enough effect to the model performace.
